About Dataset 

This dataset includes two CSV files: the raw, unprocessed data and a partially cleaned and transformed version. 
The data contains detailed information about perfumes, including fragrance notes, ratings, main accords, perfumers, and more. 
It was sourced through web scraping from Fragrantica.com, one of the largest fragrance databases online.
This cleaned version allows for easier analysis, with certain inconsistencies addressed and specific transformations applied.

Data Files:

Raw Data (fragrantica_raw.csv): This is the original scraped data, containing all raw information collected from the site, 
without any modifications.
Cleaned Data (fra_cleaned.csv): A partially cleaned and transformed version of the dataset.
This file addresses inconsistencies in the raw data and applies transformations to several columns for easier analysis.
